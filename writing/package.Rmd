If you frequently find yourself using just one function from another package, you can copy the code and add it to your own package. For example, I have a package for personal use that borrows %nin% from the Hmisc package because I think it's a great function, but I don't often use anything else from Hmisc. With roxygen2, it's easy to add @author and @references to properly attribute the code for a borrowed function. Also make sure the package licenses are compatible when doing this.
