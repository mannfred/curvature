If you frequently find yourself using just one function from another package, you can copy the code and add it to your own package. For example, I have a package for personal use that borrows %nin% from the Hmisc package because I think it's a great function, but I don't often use anything else from Hmisc. With roxygen2, it's easy to add @author and @references to properly attribute the code for a borrowed function. Also make sure the package licenses are compatible when doing this.

sanity test: Using the canonical definition of curvature (the inverse radius), the curvature of a unit circle is 1 at all points (1/r = 1/1 = 1). We created a function for a partial (half??) cirlce for x={0,0.9999}: circlefun<-function(x) (1-(x^2))^0.5. Because the radius is 1, the segment
