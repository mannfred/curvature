Looks to me like a logistic. Log growth phase followed by levelling off. Would be interesting for fun to log transform growth axis to see how the log growth phase looks. 

PS the end of the log growth phase, ie intercept between two straight lines (log growth line and plateau line) on log linear plot is also a developmental marker




What story to tell?
development of Epimedium koreanum and Epimedium violaceum (
inflections (S-shape) in Epimedium grandiflorum
comparing mature grandiflorum to mature koreanum and violaceum

For koreanum and violaceum data:

X define developmental stages (first time done for epidmedium) and correlate with size 
correlate size with elapsed_days
model time and size for stages 
correlate size with curvature
correlate time with curvature
define curvature for stages
