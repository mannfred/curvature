#### Vector-valued functions

The curves found in nature are sometimes best described by multi-valued fuctions, i.e. functions that allow the curve to have several Y-values for a single X-position (e.g. spirals). For this reason, the standard $y=f(x)$ notation will not suffice, and instead we introduce the concept of a vector-valued function. 

We first introduce the concept of a vector-valued function. Physically, a vector can be thought of as an arrow-like object with length and direction (Figure 2). A vector that exists in a coordinate plane "points" to an $(x, y)$ location and is called a _position vector_.  The $x$ and $y$ components of a position vector can be handled separately as scaled _unit vectors_ of length 1.  Therefore, the length of a position vector is computed as the Euclidian distance (hypotenuse) between its rectangular $x$ and $y$  unit vector components. A vector's direction is determined by its relative orientation to an arbitrarily chosen fixed line (_e.g._ the $x$-axis). Because vectors can "point" to a location on a coordinate plane, an $(x, y)$ coordinate can 
can be rewritten as a position vector <center> $\mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j}$,  </center> 

Where $\mathbf{i}$  and $\mathbf{j}$ are orthogonal unit vectors fixed on the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively, and $\mathbf{r}$ is the resultant position vector pointing to some point $(x, y)$ ([Figure 4](Figures/Figure_4.jpg)).  

Now, instead of the typical $f(x) = y$ notation for a function, consider a curve as the path traced by a moving particle that passes through a set of $(x, y)$ points, described by two time-dependent functions <center> $x = \hat{x}(t)$, <br> $y = \hat{y}(t)$, </center>

where $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ denote that $x$ and $y$ are functions of time $t$.  This parameterization is convenient because we would like to treat position vectors as composites of the unit vectors $\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{j}$.  Consequently, we can combine the concepts of eqs 1 and 2 to produce a _vector-valued function_  <center> $\mathbf{\hat{r}}(t) = \hat{x}(t)\mathbf{i} + \hat{y}(t)\mathbf{j}$ ,  </center> 

where $\mathbf{\hat{r}}(t)$ is a function that produces a position vector $\mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j}$ determined by $t$. 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\bar{r}}(s) = \bar{x}(s)\mathbf{i} + \bar{y}(s)\mathbf{j} && \text{(eq. 1)}
\end{align}
$$

Where $\mathbf{\bar{r}}(s)$ indicates that the position vector $\mathbf{r}$ is determined by its arc length $s$. 
When a curve is parameterized by its arc length, for every arc length increment ($ds$) that we move along the curve, we generate a position vector $\mathbf{r}$ indicating the $(x, y)$ location in the coordinate plane. 


This is because as ${\Delta s \to 0}$, the length of the tangent vector ($d\mathbf{r}$) and the length of the arc segment ($ds$) become equal. In this case, the tangent vector is called the _unit tangent vector_.
