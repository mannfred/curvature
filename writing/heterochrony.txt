Floral morphology can evolve through the differential timing (heterochrony) and positioning (heterotopy) of floral trait expression [@rudall_2004; @kostyun_2017; @naghiloo_2017]. For example, in _Jaltomata_ (Solanaceae), derived tubular and campanulate corolla shapes evolved by the acceleration and extension of growth from an ancestral rotate form [@kostyun_2017].

&emsp;&emsp; These patterns are strongly suggestive of heterochrony leading eventually to convergence in shape. In _E. koreanum_ nectar spur curvature develops early, becoming less curved as the spurs emerge from the flower bud and elongate (Figure S6). In _E. violaceum_, this process is less pronounced. As discussed in Section 1, it is possible that curvature develops in flower buds in response to a constraint for space. In the case of _E. koreanum_ this early onset curvature is corrected as the nectar spur develops so that at maturity there are no detectable differences in shape between the two taxa. It is possible that the longer maturation time in _E. koreanum_ is a result of correcting for differences in floral form conferred in the bud.  The differences in floral development as observed here ['acceleration' sensu @rudall_2004] creates the potential for novel phenotypes to affect fitness (e.g. via pollination), in some cases driving plant diversification [reviewed in @rudall_2004]. That closely related taxa within the _E. grandiflorum_ complex can measurably differ in floral development suggests that heterochrony could play a role in generating floral diversity within _Epimedium_ at large.
